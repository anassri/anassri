# **Hello!**

### **This is Ammar, I'm a web developer, designer, animator, filmmaker, and learner.**

I'm a software engineer with a Computer Engineering degree, a master's in Animation, and a web development bootcamp background. In 2020, I dove into web development to craft tech that adds some sunshine to life.

I'm currently at Build.com, cooking up features for the coolest ecommerce store.

Beyond code, you'll find me immersed in personal projects, exploring new tech, or balancing life with woodworking, gym sessions, and family time. Cheers to the dynamic dance between pixels and real-world adventures!
